# OmniAuth::Amazon
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wingrunr21/omniauth-amazon.png)](https://travis-ci.org/wingrunr21/omniauth-amazon) [![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-amazon.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/omniauth-amazon)

[Login with Amazon](https://login.amazon.com/) OAuth2 strategy for OmniAuth 2.0

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'omniauth-amazon'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install omniauth-amazon

## Prereqs

You must create an application via the [Amazon App Console](https://login.amazon.com/manageApps). Once that is complete, register two URLs under <i>Web Settings -> Allowed Return URLs</i>:

    http://localhost:3000/auth/amazon/callback
    https://your_website_here/auth/amazon/callback

Amazon requires HTTPS for the whitelisted callback URL (except localhost). They don't appear to
like ```.dev``` domains too much but happily accept localhost.

## Usage

Usage is similar to other OAuth2 based OmniAuth strategies:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :amazon, ENV['AMAZON_CLIENT_ID'], ENV['AMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET'],
    {
      :scope => 'profile postal_code' # default scope
    }
end
```

## Configuration

Config options can be passed to `provider` via a `Hash`:

* `scope`: A space-separated list of permissions. Can be `profile`,
  `postal_code`, `profile:user_id`, or a combination of options.  
  Defaults to: `profile postal_code`
    * Requesting the `profile:user_id` scope will not display an additional consent
      screen the first time the user logs in.

## Todo
1. Fix ```raw_info``` to see why ```client.request``` has to be used in query
   mode
